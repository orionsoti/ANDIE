## Getting Started:

>To get started navigate to the file menu and open the image you wish to edit.

>There are many ways to edit your image from changing colour values, applying filters and transforming your image.

>These can be found in the corresponding menus, descriptions of each action can be found in the features section.

>You can undo and redo any action you've made using the edit menu and adjust the view of your image in the view menu
